# Example register definition file. 
# Device is a Eastron SDM630 power meter. Register specification e.g.
# available at http://www.ausboard.net.au/index_files/Eastron/Eastron%20Modbus%20Registers.pdf
#
# The Slave ID is assumed to be 1 (which is default for the SDM630)
# The function code used for reading is READ REGISTER (4), which is default
# Data format for all registers is float. Polling interval is 15s.
#
# All those defaults are set with a magic "DEFAULT" topic definition and
# are then inherited by subsequent register definitions.
